      <h1>History</h1>
      <p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic">
        Coltivare started in a kitchen on a family farm outside <b>Decatur, Illinois</b> in 2012.

         <h2>Our Story</h2>
         <ul> 
           <li>An agronomist</li>
            <li>a farm equipment mechanic</li>
            <li>a software engineer</li>
            <br>
           set out to make growing food easier with <b><u>practical</u></b> tools farmers would actually use. 
          Their first project was a simple soil sensor connected to a phone app. It helped a neighbor time irrigation better and cut water use without hurting yields. 
           Word spread quick by word of mouth, and that early success set our direction. By 2014 we had a test plot and a clear goal to build reliable, affordable tools for farms of all sizes. 
         We focused on saving time, reducing guesswork, and designing for real field conditions. Early products included soil and weather sensors and a basic dashboard that pulled data into one place. 
      We installed the gear ourselves and trained crews on site because technology only works when people trust it. From 2016 to 2019 we grew from central Illinois across the Midwest and the Plains. 
         Customers asked for more, so we added crop scouting tools, variable rate plans, and preseason to postseason support. 
      When equipment visibility became a pain point, we built simple telematics that track fuel, maintenance, and location. 
         When timing inputs mattered more, we turned field data into <i>clear recommendations</i> that tied back to margins.
