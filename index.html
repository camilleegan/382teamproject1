<font color = "white size = "12">Coltivare started at a kitchen table on a family farm outside Decatur, Illinois in 2012. An agronomist, a farm equipment mechanic, and a software engineer set out to make growing food easier with practical tools farmers would actually use. 
Their first project was a simple soil sensor tied to a phone app. It helped a neighbor time irrigation better and cut water use without hurting yields. Word spread through co ops and coffee shops, and that early success set our direction.
By 2014 we had a test plot and a clear goal to build reliable, affordable tools for farms of all sizes. We focused on saving time, reducing guesswork, and designing for real field conditions. Early products included soil and weather sensors and a basic dashboard that pulled data into one place. 
We installed the gear ourselves and trained crews on site because technology only works when people trust it. From 2016 to 2019 we grew from central Illinois across the Midwest and the Plains. Customers asked for more, so we added crop scouting tools, variable rate plans, and preseason to postseason support. 
When equipment visibility became a pain point, we built simple telematics that track fuel, maintenance, and location. When timing inputs mattered more, we turned field data into clear recommendations that tied back to margins.
Today Coltivare offers field hardware, a unified software platform, and hands on advisory and service. Our systems connect with common monitors and record keeping tools so teams can adopt at their own pace. 
The measure that matters to us is whether operations see steadier yields, better use of inputs, and time saved during the busiest weeks. We listen first. Product road maps come from customer councils, winter workshops, and side by side field trials. 
Our agronomists and technicians live in the communities we serve, and when the forecast shifts, we show up. Looking ahead, demand is rising, inputs are costly, and weather is less predictable. Our mission is to help producers manage those realities with tools that are simple, reliable, and grounded in agronomy. 
The kitchen table has become a multi state team, but the promise is the same. We build for the people who grow.</font>
